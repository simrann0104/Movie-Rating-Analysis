# Data Analysis for Movie Ratings

We need to conduct a data analysis on movie ratings by critics and audiences, as well as movie budgets, for the years 2007-2011 for an article for a movie analytics firm. 
The analysis is performed using R programming with the GGPLOT2 library.
All the R programming code is documented in the "Data Analysis for Movie Ratings using R Programming" file, and the '.png' files in the repository are visualizations of the analysis created after each program code segment.
